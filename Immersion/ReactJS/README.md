# [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

ReactJS is considered as an open-source JavaScript library rather than a framework. It is mainly used for building amazing user interfaces with a great focus on rendering performance. In MVC(Model View Controller) architecture, React is more dependent on “V”.<br />

ReactJS quickly gained a good reputation when it was launched first. It was built with the aim of resolving issues in JavaScript frameworks related to efficient rendering of large datasets.<sup>[1]</sup>.

*Top 3 reasons to use it*

* SEO Effective
* Components in ReactJS
* Great efficiency.

Search engines find it difficult to read JavaScript heavy applications even after having improvements in that area. So this is one of the big issues that come with JavaScript frameworks.
But ReactJS has beaten up this. You can easily run ReactJS on the server and the virtual DOM will be rendered then which further return to the browser as a regular web page. No hard tricks are required for this.
PolymerJS and Shadow DOM has already created a lot of buzzes which are typically used to create customizable elements, self-contained elements that you can easily import into your project.

But ReactJS makes you able to create your own components which you can later combine, reuse or nest your core content. So it doesn’t make use of Shadow DOM or PolymerJS.
ReactJS creates its own virtual DOM where your components actually live. It takes care of all the changes to made in the DOM and updates in the DOM tree also. This makes it a flexible approach to gain a good performance. Hence, it discards costly DOM operations and regularly makes updates efficiently.
